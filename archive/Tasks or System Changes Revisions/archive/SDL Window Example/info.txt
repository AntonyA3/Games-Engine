SDL_Dynamic linking

Summary
Analysis / Preconditions / Postcondition
SDL has usuful features for creating simulation software in windows, I have read the documentation and have knowlege of setting it up.

I have set up SDL before, though I will use dynamic linking, so I should tread carefully, since i usually statically link SDL2

-I'm following these instructions https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/mingw/index.php

Actually I have always been dynamically linking SDL2

Algorithms / Approach
Test Design / Psuedo Implementation / Mathmatical Model
<S>Unistall old SDL2 dependancies in msys2</S>
Use the msys2 sdl2 pacman installation

Test Design
Can I see an SDL Window : Done

with a title, Hello SDL2 : Done
viewport with any colour (likely black) : Done
can be closed, : Done
can be minimise, : Done
has the expand button : Done
has resize handles : Done
at a visible size (likely of 640 by 480) : Done
Task Evaluation
I have set an include path for SDL2 make sure that this does not change
There were some unexpected scenarios that occured when I was working on this task
Consider making an abstraction,for this that will build the window, based on what can be customised
Resizable
Title
minimizable
Start Size
