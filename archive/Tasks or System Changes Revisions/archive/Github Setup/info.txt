I need to be able to connect my current git repository to a remote github repository

Analysis / Preconditions / Postcondition

Algorithms / Approach
N/A

Follow the steps to set up a git repository from my local repository

Test Design
Description: An engine for a breakout clone game, that will be expanded to create other styles of 2D games.
git commit "Created Github Repository"
rename git branch -m "master" "dev"
git master branch to dev
verify name change with git branch

git remote add origin https://github.com/AntonyA3/Games-Engine.git
Add github.com via windows credential manager image 0

get access rights to repo
pull from git --allow-unrelated-histories

commit "Integrated github"
push to origin

verify that this commit has been pushed to github


Task Evaluation
The task was low risk, however it was difficult to complete this, than I expected, because I needed to remember to --allow-unrelated-histories and Set up github credentials with credential manager
