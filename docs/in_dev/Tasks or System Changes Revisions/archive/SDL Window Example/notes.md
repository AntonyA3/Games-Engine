# SDL Window Example

## Summary

The aim of this task was to initialise a window using the SDL library. This was to make sure that I would be able to provide a good abstraction for and SDL window in the future

## What I did
- I created an folder in Explorations called Hello_SDL2. 
- I created a makefile to build the sample program. 
- The sample program open an SDL2 window, and keeps it open until it is closed

# Analysis Implications
- I was able to extract some properties that could be useful for an SDLWindowWrapper abstraction
# Design Implications
- For this task there was no design, because this became part of the way to figure out what should be part of the design

# Implementation Implications
- No abstractions created, or system implementation.

# Testing Implications
- Consider for future tests

# Maintenance Implications
- Consider for future

# Next steps
- Work on the SDLWindowWrapper Abstraction
