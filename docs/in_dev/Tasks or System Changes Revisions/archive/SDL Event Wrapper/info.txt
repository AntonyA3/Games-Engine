Summary
While creating the SDL window, I realised that I needed a way to abstract the event process

Analysis / Preconditions / Postcondition
I would need to add a method to get a reference to the next event
to get whether there is a next event
Algorithms / Approach
Test Design / Psuedo Implementation / Mathmatical Model
Test Design
If the active Event count matches the polled event counts, after the while loop is complete, then this abstraction is more likely to have been implemented correctly
