- 4 Initialisation of OpenGl in an SDL Window
- Risk: I may need to decouple an abstraction

# Summary
How can I add an openGL rendering within the SDL Window, then create an abstraction from this
# What I did or will do
 - Explore Solution
 - Modify Designs to accomodate new Abstractions 
 - Implement abstractions
 - Test if they meet the criteria as described in Testing Implications

# Design Implications
- Consider a A sequence Diagram for the project
- Add new abstractions to UML Diagram

# Implementation Implications
- a new class to wra SDLOpenGL operations

# Testing Implications
- Integration Testing 
- A grey screen is displayed

Relevant Test
![Relevent Tests](tests\SDL_Window_Wrapper)
# Maintenance Implications
- I might need a sequence Diagram 

# Next steps
- ImGUI Implementation
