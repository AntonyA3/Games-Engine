# 8 Dear Imgui Abstraction 09/10/2022
- Risk: May need to swap and replace some existing classes

## Summary
I will be adding ImGui to this application. This will
is likely to require changing some of the designs and adding new implementation

What I did or will do
- Explore solutions to the problems of initialising Imgui and displaying a demo window with it
- Modify the class design


## Design Implications
- This is a subset of the design that was added

## Implementation Implications
These files are relevant


## Testing Implications
 - By integration testing 
 - It is expected for
 - The demo window to be able to be displayed

## Maintenance Implications
- I will likely be adding a new imgui Window

## Next steps
- Start trying to create a shader that can render polygons
